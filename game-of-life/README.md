# Conway's Game of Life

#### What is the Game of Life?
* The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
* The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
* One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
