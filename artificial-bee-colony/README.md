# Artificial Bee Colony

#### What is Artificial Bee Colony?
* The artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behaviour of the honeybee swarm, proposed by Derviş Karaboğa (Erciyes University) in 2005.

* In the ABC model, the colony consists of three groups of bees: employed bees, onlookers and scouts. 

* It is assumed that there is only one artificial employed bee for each food source.
