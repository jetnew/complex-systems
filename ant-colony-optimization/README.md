# Ant Colony Optimization

#### What is Ant Colony Optimization?
* The ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs.

* Artificial Ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behaviour of real ants.

* The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the paradigm used.
