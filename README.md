# Complex Systems
* A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other.
* Complex systems are systems whose behaviour is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment.
* Systems that are "complex" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaption, and feedback loops, among others.

#### Multi-Agent System
* A multi-agent system (MAS or "self-organized system") is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.
* Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve.
* Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning.
