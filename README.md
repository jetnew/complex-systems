# Multi-Agent Systems

#### Multi-Agent System
* A multi-agent system (MAS or "self-organized system") is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents.
* Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve.
* Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. 

#### Conway's Game of Life
* The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
* The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
* One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
